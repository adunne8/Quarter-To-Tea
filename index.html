            <h2 class="section-header">Who Are We</h2>
            <div class="container container-grid"></div>
            <p>We started out as a group of college students, studting collinary science in DIT together. Inbetween intense
                study sessions and project deadlines we ofthen found ourselves together looking for somewhere to relax and
                chat together. We started arguing the age old argument of Barry or Lyons, which quickly evolved into the
                more inticate discussions as to the merrits of each type of tea. Unfortunately we found the Dublin area lacking
                for places to source and sample some of the delicious brews de discovered while on various trips abroad.
                We began to dream about a place where we could share our discoveries together. We soon realised we were the
                perfoect group to setup our own place. Passionate, knowledgeable and just innocent enough to think setting
                up a company would be easy. Well it wasn't easy but we've made it this far. Why not pop in and see what we
                have in stock this week</p>
            <h3 class="sub">Why 'Quarter To Tea'?</h3>
            <p>its a bit of an inside joke between us. We always had 15 mins between classes to catch up together and an old
                saying, "What time is it? A Quarter to Tea" quickly emerged. </p>
            <p> ...We still regularly argue who originally said this phrase</p>
